# project3d

## About
- I've been developing this project as a prototype to become more familiar with 3D game development.
- My focus was learning landscape development, animation, and both 3rd person and 1st person movement.

## Future updates / Project legacy
Currently I've been developing this project as a prototype but I would like to turn it into a sci-fi horror game.
